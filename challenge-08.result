In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account named "Jia Tan". This backdoor allows an attacker with a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code on affected Linux systems. It has been assigned the CVE number CVE-2024-3094 and a CVSS score of 10.0, indicating a critical vulnerability. Although xz is commonly found in most Linux distributions, the backdoored version was not widely deployed in production systems at the time of discovery. The issue was uncovered by software developer Andres Freund, who announced it on March 29, 2024.
