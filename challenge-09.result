### Overview of Global Warming

**Definition and Causes:**
Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas). This process enhances the greenhouse effect, where gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides trap heat in the atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels have risen by about 50%, reaching concentrations not seen for millions of years.

**Effects:**
The impacts of global warming are profound and widespread:
- **Environmental Changes:** Increased temperatures lead to the expansion of deserts, more frequent heatwaves, and wildfires. The Arctic is experiencing amplified warming, resulting in thawing permafrost, glacier retreat, and declining sea ice.
- **Extreme Weather:** Higher temperatures contribute to more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.
- **Biodiversity Loss:** Rapid environmental changes force many species to relocate or face extinction.
- **Human Impact:** Global warming threatens human health, food and water security, and economic stability. The World Health Organization identifies climate change as one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century.

**Current Trends:**
As of 2023, the global average temperature has risen by approximately 1.48 °C (2.66 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850. The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to well below 2 °C, with efforts to keep it under 1.5 °C. However, current pledges suggest a potential rise of about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
To combat global warming, strategies include:
- Transitioning to renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear).
- Enhancing energy efficiency and conservation.
- Increasing forest cover and adopting agricultural practices that capture carbon.
